# Sandbox_Project
Overview

The Sandbox Project is a mini machine learning platform designed to perform various tasks on the Diamonds dataset. It aims to solve classification, regression, and clustering problems related to diamond features using different techniques including artificial neural networks. The project focuses on three main objectives:

1.	Diamond Clarity Classification: Determine the clarity classes of diamonds based on their features.
2.	Diamond Price Estimation: Develop a model to predict diamond prices using regression techniques.
3.	Customer Segmentation: Cluster diamonds into sub-groups for better customer segmentation strategies.

Libraries Used
1.	Numpy
2.	Pandas
3.	Matplotlib
4.	Seaborn
5.	Scikit-Learn
6.	Keras

Features
•	Classification: Diamond clarity classes prediction.
•	Regression: Diamond price estimation.
•	Clustering: Customer segmentation based on diamond features.
